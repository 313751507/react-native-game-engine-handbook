A React Native app showcasing some examples using the lightweight [react-native-game-engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine) library.

## Quick Start IOS

```
git clone https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine-handbook.git

cd react-native-game-engine-handbook

npm install

react-native link

react-native run-ios
```

> Use ```react-native run-ios --configuration Release``` for release build (better performance).

## Quick Start Android

```
git clone https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine-handbook.git

cd react-native-game-engine-handbook

npm install

react-native link

react-native run-android
```

> Installing a release build on an Android device is slightly more involved (requires signing). See [running on device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html) for details.
